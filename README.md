# College-Management-System

This project is a full‑stack **College Management System (CMS)** developed to computerize and integrate day‑to‑day academic and administrative activities in a single secure web application. The system supports **role‑based modules for Admin, Faculty, and Students**: Admins can manage user accounts and roles, maintain master data such as **departments and semesters**, create and manage **courses**, handle **student enrollments**, and access **analytics and reporting**; Faculty can view/manage their assigned courses, create **class sessions**, record **attendance**, create **assignments**, and enter/update **grades**; Students can access their **enrolled courses**, view **attendance history**, and track **grades and academic performance**. The application includes a modern **dashboard** with key statistics and visual summaries using charts to provide quick insights, along with searchable and organized management screens for students, courses, enrollments, and other records. A dedicated **Reports** module enables administrators to **export institutional data to CSV** and generate **PDF-ready reports** (via print-to-PDF) for documentation and decision‑making. Technically, the front end is built using **React (React 18)** with a responsive UI styled using **Tailwind CSS**, while the backend is powered by **Supabase** using **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage, **Supabase Auth** for secure login/signup and session handling, and **PostgREST APIs** for data access. Database security is enforced through **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies so each role can only read/write the data permitted to them, ensuring privacy, integrity, and controlled access. Overall, the CMS provides an efficient, scalable, and secure solution that improves accuracy, reduces manual paperwork, enhances transparency across academic workflows, and enables faster administrative operations through automation and centralized data management.
